<h2 id="composer-json-publish-using-composer">composer.json â€“ Publish Using Composer</h2>
<p>We recommend to create a <code>composer.json</code> file for each plugin. we have created a composer installer for plugins, which make it easy to install plugins in the correct folder by a single line of code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">composer require mycompany/my-cool-plugin:dev-master
</code></pre>
<p>here is an example <code>composer.json</code> file which must be located in the root of your repository, if you add a <code>composer.json</code> file to your repository please also add your repository to <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist.org</a></p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;mycompany/my-cool-plugin&quot;, // will result in install path: plugins/mycompany/myCoolPlugin
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;phile-plugin&quot;, // this type is important
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;license&quot;: &quot;MIT&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;a short description of your plugin&quot;, // add a short description here
    &quot;homepage&quot;: &quot;http://philecms.com&quot;, // feel free to add your homepage or repo url
    &quot;keywords&quot;: [&quot;cms&quot;, &quot;phile&quot;, &quot;myTag&quot;], // please use the tags &quot;cms&quot; and &quot;phile&quot; for each plugin and add your own
    &quot;authors&quot;: [
        {

            &quot;email&quot;: &quot;dave@example.com&quot;,
            &quot;homepage&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/&quot;,
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Developer&quot;
        }
    ],
    &quot;require&quot;: {
