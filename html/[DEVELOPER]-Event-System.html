<p>One of the main feature of Phile is new event system, which replace the hook system of pico.</p>
<p>In the core Phile triggers a lot of events, and for every event you can register your plugin to get informed. Depending on the event data is passed along an can be manipulated by the plugin. </p>
<p>You can find a list of all triggered events on the startpage of the demo pages after installing Phile.</p>
<p>The easiest way to subscribe to events is using the <code>$events</code> property in your plugin:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">class Plugin extends \Phile\Plugin\AbstractPlugin {

    protected $events = [&#39;after_load_content&#39; =&gt; &#39;doStuff&#39;];

    protected doStuff($data) { 
        // do something
    }
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s it. Now when the <code>after_load_content</code> event happens <code>doStuff()</code> is called.</p>
